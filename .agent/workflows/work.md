# Work Plan Execution Command

Execute a work plan efficiently while maintaining quality and finishing features.

## Introduction

This command takes a work document (plan, specification, or todo file) and executes it systematically. The focus is on **shipping complete features** by understanding requirements quickly, following existing patterns, and maintaining quality throughout.

## Input Document

<input_document> #$ARGUMENTS </input_document>

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Start

1. **Read Plan and Clarify**

   - Read the work document completely
   - Review any references or links provided in the plan
   - If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions now
   - Get user approval to proceed
   - **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing

2. **Setup Environment**

   Choose your work style:

   **Option A: Live work on current branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```

   **Option B: Parallel work with worktree (recommended for parallel development)**
   ```bash
   # Ask user first: "Work in parallel with worktree or on current branch?"
   # If worktree:
   skill: git-worktree
   # The skill will create a new branch from main in an isolated worktree
   ```

   **Recommendation**: Use worktree if:
   - You want to work on multiple features simultaneously
   - You want to keep main clean while experimenting
   - You plan to switch between branches frequently

   Use live branch if:
   - You're working on a single feature
   - You prefer staying in the main repository

3. **Create Todo List**
   - Use TodoWrite to break plan into actionable tasks
   - Include dependencies between tasks
   - Prioritize based on what needs to be done first
   - Include testing and quality check tasks
   - Keep tasks specific and completable

### Phase 2: Execute

1. **Task Execution Loop**

   For each task in priority order:

   ```
   while (tasks remain):
     - Mark task as in_progress in TodoWrite
     - Read any referenced files from the plan
     - Look for similar patterns in codebase
     - Implement following existing conventions
     - Write tests for new functionality
     - Run tests after changes
     - Mark task as completed
   ```

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**

   - The plan should reference similar code - read those files first
   - Match naming conventions exactly
   - Reuse existing components where possible
   - Follow project coding standards (see .agent/rules/)
   - When in doubt, grep for similar implementations

3. **Test Continuously**

   - Run relevant tests after each significant change
   - Don't wait until the end to test
   - Fix failures immediately
   - Add new tests for new functionality

4. **Figma Design Sync** (if applicable)

   For UI work with Figma designs:

   - Implement components following design specs
   - Use figma-design-sync agent iteratively to compare
   - Fix visual differences identified
   - Repeat until implementation matches design

5. **Track Progress**
   - Keep TodoWrite updated as you complete tasks
   - Note any blockers or unexpected discoveries
   - Create new tasks if scope expands
   - Keep user informed of major milestones

### Phase 3: Quality Check

1. **Run Core Quality Checks**

   Always run before submitting:

   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   bin/rails test

   # Run linting (per .agent/rules/)
   # Use linting-agent before pushing to origin
   ```

2. **Consider Reviewer Agents** (Optional)

   Use for complex, risky, or large changes:

   - **code-simplicity-reviewer**: Check for unnecessary complexity
   - **kieran-rails-reviewer**: Verify Rails conventions (Rails projects)
   - **performance-oracle**: Check for performance issues
   - **security-sentinel**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
   - **cora-test-reviewer**: Review test quality (CORA projects)

   Run reviewers in parallel with Task tool:

   ```
   Task(code-simplicity-reviewer): "Review changes for simplicity"
   Task(kieran-rails-reviewer): "Check Rails conventions"
   ```

   Present findings to user and address critical issues.

3. **Final Validation**
   - All TodoWrite tasks marked completed
   - All tests pass
   - Linting passes
   - Code follows existing patterns
   - Figma designs match (if applicable)
   - No console errors or warnings

### Phase 4: Delivery

**Development is complete.**

1.  **Verify Locally:** Ensure all tests pass.
2.  **Handover:**
    **STOP HERE.** Do not execute any further commands.
