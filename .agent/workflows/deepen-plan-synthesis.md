# Deepen Plan - Phase 3: Synthesis Execution

## Context
Target Plan: <plan_path> #$ARGUMENTS </plan_path>

## Main Tasks

### 6. Wait for ALL Agents and Synthesize Everything

<thinking>
Wait for ALL parallel agents to complete - skills, research agents, review agents, everything. Then synthesize all findings into a comprehensive enhancement.
</thinking>

**Collect outputs from ALL sources:**

1. **Skill-based sub-agents** - Each skill's full output (code examples, patterns, recommendations)
2. **Learnings/Solutions sub-agents** - Relevant documented learnings from /workflows:compound
3. **Research agents** - Best practices, documentation, real-world examples
4. **Review agents** - All feedback from every reviewer (architecture, security, performance, simplicity, etc.)
5. **Context7 queries** - Framework documentation and patterns
6. **Web searches** - Current best practices and articles

**For each agent's findings, extract:**
- [ ] Concrete recommendations (actionable items)
- [ ] Code patterns and examples (copy-paste ready)
- [ ] Anti-patterns to avoid (warnings)
- [ ] Performance considerations (metrics, benchmarks)
- [ ] Security considerations (vulnerabilities, mitigations)
- [ ] Edge cases discovered (handling strategies)
- [ ] Documentation links (references)
- [ ] Skill-specific patterns (from matched skills)
- [ ] Relevant learnings (past solutions that apply - prevent repeating mistakes)

**Deduplicate and prioritize:**
- Merge similar recommendations from multiple agents
- Prioritize by impact (high-value improvements first)
- Flag conflicting advice for human review
- Group by plan section

### 7. Enhance Plan Sections

<thinking>
Merge research findings back into the plan, adding depth without changing the original structure.
</thinking>

**Enhancement format for each section:**

```markdown
## [Original Section Title]

[Original content preserved]

### Research Insights

**Best Practices:**
- [Concrete recommendation 1]
- [Concrete recommendation 2]

**Performance Considerations:**
- [Optimization opportunity]
- [Benchmark or metric to target]

**Implementation Details:**
```[language]
// Concrete code example from research
```

**Edge Cases:**
- [Edge case 1 and how to handle]
- [Edge case 2 and how to handle]

**References:**
- [Documentation URL 1]
- [Documentation URL 2]
```

### 8. Add Enhancement Summary

At the top of the plan, add a summary section:

```markdown
## Enhancement Summary

**Deepened on:** [Date]
**Sections enhanced:** [Count]
**Research agents used:** [List]

### Key Improvements
1. [Major improvement 1]
2. [Major improvement 2]
3. [Major improvement 3]

### New Considerations Discovered
- [Important finding 1]
- [Important finding 2]
```

### 9. Update Plan File

**Write the enhanced plan:**
- Preserve original filename
- Add `-deepened` suffix if user prefers a new file
- Update any timestamps or metadata

## Output Format

Update the plan file in place (or create `.agent/templates/plans/<original-name>-deepened.md` if requested).

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing:
- [ ] All original content preserved
- [ ] Research insights clearly marked and attributed
- [ ] Code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] Links are valid and relevant
- [ ] No contradictions between sections
- [ ] Enhancement summary accurately reflects changes

## Example Enhancement

**Before (from /workflows:plan):**
```markdown
## Technical Approach

Use React Query for data fetching with optimistic updates.
```

**After (from /workflows:deepen-plan):**
```markdown
## Technical Approach

Use React Query for data fetching with optimistic updates.

### Research Insights

**Best Practices:**
- Configure `staleTime` and `cacheTime` based on data freshness requirements
- Use `queryKey` factories for consistent cache invalidation
- Implement error boundaries around query-dependent components

**Performance Considerations:**
- Enable `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` for stable data to reduce unnecessary requests
- Use `select` option to transform and memoize data at query level
- Consider `placeholderData` for instant perceived loading

**Implementation Details:**

    // Recommended query configuration
    const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
        queries: {
        staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
        retry: 2,
        refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
        },
    },
    });


**Edge Cases:**
- Handle race conditions with `cancelQueries` on component unmount
- Implement retry logic for transient network failures
- Consider offline support with `persistQueryClient`

**NEVER CODE!**

Your job is to **research** and **enhance the plan**, not to implement the plan.
- Do not write implementation files.
- Do not modify source code.
- ONLY modify the markdown plan file.
